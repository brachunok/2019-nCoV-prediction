# GEOPROCESSED

These are the outputs of the geoprocessing done in arcGIS. (For ben's future reference, it's the _china centroids_ layer's attributes table exported to CSV)


The 'point location database' lists the point ID (pointID) and associated lat and lon. This is useful if we want to combine additional data with the geoprocessed stuff.
